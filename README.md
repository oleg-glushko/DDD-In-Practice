It's an adoption of the "[Domain-Driven Design In Practice](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/domain-driven-design-in-practice)" course's [samples](https://github.com/vkhorikov/DddInAction) to .NET 6 / EF Core 6. I had to make some (questionable) adjustments to keep the original DB model untouched due to discrepancies in functionality between NHibernate and EF Core.

Another big difference is in the UI, which is simplified a bit. Instead of writing a boilerplate MVVM code, I used the [Community Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/introduction) for observables and commands. Also, I did drop a dialog window functionality, so all pages now are controlled by and embedded into the MainWindow.

You should create a database using the attached SQL script. If necessary, adjust a connection string before running any of the examples. It's in the "App.xaml.cs" of all UI projects and AtmSpecs.cs of the "1-DddInPractice-EventsClassicApproach" solution.
